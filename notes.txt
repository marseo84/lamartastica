IMPROVEMENTS

State Management: 
		As your app grows, you might consider using a service or store (like NgRx) to manage state more efficiently.

Lazy Loading: 
		For better performance, especially with larger apps, consider using lazy loading for feature modules (like projects and services).

API Integration: 
		Replace static data with real API calls if you have a backend to serve project or service data.

SEO: 
		For improved SEO, consider setting up Angular Universal for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) to make your app more crawlable by search engines.




styleUrl typo:
							The property in the @Component decorator should be styleUrls (plural), not styleUrl.

getProjectsByCategory method:
							You're using this function to filter projects based on category. It’s fine for a static dataset, but for dynamic data (e.g., fetched from a backend), the filtering should be done either in the DataService or directly through an API call.

Commented-out code:
							Clean up the commented-out this.dataService.getProjects() call if you don’t plan to use it.

Dynamic Data:
						Ensure that this.dataService.getProjects(category) correctly fetches the filtered data from the backend or service. You might need to adapt the API response handling.
